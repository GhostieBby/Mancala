# Mancala

Welcome to Mancala!

First you'll want to select the game mode you wish to play. You can play against either the computer our a friend.

The goal of the game is to get as many marbles into your pod as possible, and there are two ways to do this that will be discussed later.

The game is played counter-clockwise, and it works by picking a pod you wish to move marbles from, then distributing one to each pod that follows.

The thing to keep in mind when making your move is where the last marble will be placed. If it is placed in your goal, you get another turn! The only way to gain more than one point in a turn is what's called a "steal."

To steal from your opponent's side of the board, a few conditions have to be met. Is there an empty pod on your side of the board? Does your opponent have marbles in the oppoite pod? If so, try landing your final marble in the empty pod! This will "steal" all the marbles from your opponent's pod and send them to your goal, increasing your score significantly!

The best players make use of these opportunities while simultaneously protecting their own!

Something to keep in mind is that when you are going counter-clockwise around the board to place your marbles, you have to drop one in their goal, too!

Once there are no more marbles to be moved, the game ends!
